remote help

 ‚ö° AWS EC2 instance remote control ‚ö°

 ‚ö†Ô∏è  You must set the following ENV VARS:
 INSTANCE_NAME            - The name of the instance (e.g. datascience_base)

 To make use of remote list you can optionally set:
 FILTER_PREFIX            - The prefix used to identify instances
                            of interest (e.g. datascience)

 Optionally you can also set the following if you intend to use
 the remote git command
 REMOTE_PATH              - Path to remote working repo
 LOCAL_PATH               - Path to local working repo

 ‚ö†Ô∏è  You must also have your AWS credentials set either locally
 as AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ID or as
 AWS_PROFILE, having first set your credentials with aws, usually
 in ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config using `aws configure`.

 ‚ö†Ô∏è  All commands will filter terminated instances by default

 üí™ Available commands:

 start   - Starts the instance
 git     - Sets up a remote in your local datalabs repo that 
           points to the remote repo on the instance. This 
           allows you to push code directly to your instance 
           from your local datalabs folder with git push ec2
 connect - Tries to connect to the instance
 id      - Returns the instance id e.g. i-ae23f836a5f3de
 ip      - Returns the instance public address ec2-x-x-x-x...amazonaws.com
 status  - Returns the status of the instance
 list    - Lists all the ec2 instances whose name has a prefix
           described by FILTER_PREFIX.
 type    - Changes the instance type to that specified as an
           argument \(e.g. t2.small\), otherwise returns the
           instance type
 stop    - Stops the instance

 üí™ Available options:

 -v / --verbose  - Commands return verbose output
```

## Env Variables

The following ENV vars must be set in your local env for this script to run correctly:

|ENV VAR|explanataion|Nominal value|Required?|
|---|---|---|---|
|INSTANCE_NAME|Name of the instance you wish to communicate with. Note that this requires that the tag `Name` is set on the instance of interest|datascience_base|Yes|
|FILTER_PREFIX|Prefix used to identify instances for a given task|datascience|for `remote list`|
|REMOTE_PATH|Path to remote working repository|/data/datalabs|for `remote git`|
|LOCAL_PATH|Path to local working repository|~/datalabs|for `remtoe git`|

NOTE: You must also have permission to control ec2 instances either by setting AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or by setting AWS_PROFILE and creating a corresponding profile in `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials`.
